5@com.tiggerbiggo.prima.primaplay.node.implemented.output.CommentNode@{"comment":"Lets start with the interface. The main node view (this part you\u0027re looking at now) contains all the nodes you\u0027ll be using. You can see some of the nodes above, and each one has a different function. Each one has coloured \"Links\" attached. You can link these together by clicking and dragging on them. Links can only go from like to like color, so blue cannot link to yellow, etc.","x":312.0,"y":257.0}@351@284
