# Prima
Prima is a suite of software tools for generating animated images. The library follows a "node-based" approach to rendering, much like many shader libraries, but is designed for creating visually interesting images, rather than textures for 3D rendering.

## Current Development Status
Prima is currently in active development, and new features are being added constantly to both the backend library, and the GUI. I am looking for collaborators to help me improve the User Interface, details can be found in CONTRIBUTING.MD in the root of the repo.

## Feature Roadmap
* Fix GUI issues, including visual bugs and interface layout (which is currently awful)
* Port over all previous nodes from previous version of Prima (Almost complete)
* Add new nodes to allow for more combinations of images
* Generally improve UI, including adding multi-selection of nodes, improving interface style, and QOL changes for the user
* Fully document all code, including proper javadoc for all methods / fields
